Group 21:

User Story 3: 
Users want a new iPhone 12, but they want to further customize search. 
They put “iPhone 12” into the search bar, 
to which the website will give them the typical listings from cheapest to most expensive. 
This is not enough for User, so they use a set of filters and options on the side. 
They choose “Sort by Retailer”, giving them a list of only the iPhone 12s being sold by places like Apple, BestBuy, etc. 
They then choose “Price Range” and input in two prices to get a more enclosed number of listings. 
Finally, they select an “Estimate Delivery Time Range” to see which retailers deliver to them the fastest.
