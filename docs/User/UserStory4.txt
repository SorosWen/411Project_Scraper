User Story 4:
A User wants a newly released super rare trading card. 
They type the name of the trading card into the search bar for listings, 
but to their disappointment, the price of the card is very high (maybe because of scalpers or because of hyped up prices). 
Wanting to be notified when a more fair price for the card is listed, they choose to “watch” for the name of the trading card, 
but it prompts them to sign up for an account before they can do so. 
For some reason, they do want to use a Google or Facebook Account, 
so they opt to sign up using the website instead, putting in their Username, Password, Email, etc. 
Now, when the “watched” item has a new listing, the User will be e-mailed for it. 
They can decide which listings are emailed to them, such as wanting only listings that are within a specific price range to be emailed.
