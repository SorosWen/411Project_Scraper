Group 21: 

User Story 2:
A user wants a Tesla. They type in “Tesla” into the search bar. 
The website finds no listings of a Tesla being sold online anywhere, 
so it tells the user that the item either does not exist on the market, 
or that they may have typed the item incorrectly. 
(Unfortunately, finding a Tesla online to purchase is quite difficult.)
