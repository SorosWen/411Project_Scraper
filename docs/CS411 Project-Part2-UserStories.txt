Idea 1: A web page that allows users to type in items they want to purchase through a search bar. This site will then grab related product data from retailers/e-commerce (e.g. Walmart, Ebay, BestBuy, Amazon) and list them side by side for users to compare. The user can also filter out undesired items by setting a price range, estimated delivery time, etc.
